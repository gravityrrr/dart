# My 30-Day Flutter + DSA Challenge

This repository documents my 30-day journey to become proficient in Flutter (Dart) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). I am following a structured 30-day plan that balances Flutter development with DSA practice.
My goal is to complete the daily tasks, commit my progress to this repository every day, and build a strong portfolio of projects by the end of the challenge.

## Daily Progress Log

This is where I'll document my daily learnings, challenges, and progress in detail.

### Day 1 - October 17, 2025
* **Today's Focus:** Kickoff: hello Flutter + arrays.
* **Flutter Progress:**
    * *I completed the 'Write your first Flutter app' codelab.*
    * *Learned about `main()`, `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, and `Text` widgets.*
    * *Successfully ran the first app on an emulator.*
    * *Didnt really do much of the DSA part...*
 
    * * **Thoughts:**
    * *Initial thoughts about dart is similar to that of C and its more fun to see the app hotreload everytime changes are made*
